# Welcome
This is a repository where I am solving problems from different online judges. To see any of my solutions please search the repository with the search id. I am trying to create a folder structure based on year and a quarter, in hope that will make the collection problems. 

# Finding your way around
- To see solved example please look into the closed issue section by clicking [here](https://github.com/debojyoti-majumder/CompCoding/issues?q=is:issue%20is:closed), that is where all the submitted problems would be found. There is table of all solved problems also give the list of solutions.

- Majority of the problems are solved using C++11/14 language set and using STL when ever possible. In the "Code Link" column should give you an hint in which language the problem have been implemented.

- If you want me to solve any particular problem please create an issue using this link https://github.com/debojyoti-majumder/CompCoding/issues.
